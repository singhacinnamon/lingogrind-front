                I created Lingogrind with one idea in mind: get learners communicating as fast as possible! 
                This doesn't mean forsaking a solid foundation in the language, far from it. Rather, my approach centers 
                around mastering the fundamental mechanisms that act as the backbone of a language. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                At the end of the day there's no substitute for practice, which is why I'm creating games to 
                let learners drill these mechanisms to perfection. That's why it's called Lingo<i>"grind"</i>!
                From there, I present learners with the most essential vocabulary and grammar while avoiding niche topics. 
                As a result, learners are able to reach a basic conversational level extremely quickly.

                <h1 className="ctr title">My Language Journey</h1><br></br>
                <p className="left-align">
                After growing up monolingual, I started learning Thai and Spanish when I started high school 
                in 2015 and discovered my passion for language. 
                I learned Spanish from a high school class and Thai from my grandmother, so I had two VERY different experiences. 
                Ironicallly, the ways I learned Thai and Spanish mirrored the languages themselves. Spanish is a highly structured 
                language, whereas Thai is very organic and relaxed with its grammar rules. Learning such different languages 
                really opened my eyes to just how many ways there are to communicate an idea and destroyed many preconceptions I held. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                I supplemented my learning with apps, frequent use of Google Translate, and music/shows in those languages. 
                I also practiced with native speakers whenever I could. Pro tip: There are Discord servers 
                dedicated to learning most languages where you can practice with native speakers and other learners! 
                <br></br><br></br>
                In 2019 I started college where I took two and a half years of Mandarin Chinese classes. It was a really fun 
                and fulfilling challenge for me because Mandarin is a <i>hard</i> language. Unique characters for every word 
                and lots of homophones meant much slower progress than with Thai or Spanish. Luckily I had incredible teachers 
                and there were no shortages of native speakers at my university. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                One big hurdle was that once I stopped taking 
                classes, though I was still practicing my speaking with friends, I started to rapidly forget how to write characters. 
                The thing that ultimately saved me was that I followed 
                a lot of my Chinese friends on Instagram so I could practice reading on a daily basis. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                After graduating college in June 2023 I spent 3 months living with family in Thailand. It was my first time really trying 
                the "full immersion" approach and what people don't tell you about that is that it's <i>EXHAUSTING</i>. 
                Luckily, it's also rewarding. My Thai was solid before that, if a little basic. After that experience, I finally feel 
                comfortable calling it fluent. I was also able to learn about things specific to Thailand like local institutions, geography, 
                and infrastructure. 
                <br></br><br></br>

                <h1 className="ctr title">Japanese Speedrun</h1><br></br>
                During my stay in Thailand, I went to Japan for a week to refresh my visa. Japanese is ranked as one of the five 
                most difficult languages for English speakers to learn, with the Foreign Service Institute estimating 2200 hours needed 
                to achieve proficiency. I thought it would be a fun challenge 
                to see how much Japanese I could learn in 5 days (120 hours) before going, and that experience is actually what inspired me to create Lingogrind. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                In short, I was <i>not</i> ready for what Japanese had in store for me. First, I spent a few hours researching the "profile" 
                of Japanese. Basically figuring out what was unique or challenging about the language that I would have to learn 
                so that I could make a game plan. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                The rest of days 1 and 2 were spent memorizing the Hiragana and Katakana syllabaries which have around 50 characters each. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Day 3 was learning the very unique sentence structure and particle rules as well as greetings, basic phrases, 
                and question words such as who, what, where, why, how, and when. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Day 4 was spent memorizing complex conjugation patterns and levels of politeness that left my brain 
                feeling like complete mush. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Before I knew it, I only had 1 day left and I still only knew a handful of words! So, the rest of that day as well as 
                my time in the airport was spent grinding my way through quizlet sets and online lists of the most common Japanese verbs, 
                nouns, and adjectives. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Time's Up! It was time to put what I learned to the test. The first challenges were navigating the train system 
                and purchasing tickets. I had to use polite forms speech in these settings but luckily I was prepared. I was quite slow 
                at first but after a couple hours I started to get the hang of my basic phrases and conjugations. There was 
                a pretty standard flow to these interactions which made them a perfect starting point. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Next was having conversations 
                with locals in social settings like bars and clubs. These interactions were much less scripted and covered a wide range of 
                topics so I had to fall back to English and Google Translate to learn vocabulary as I needed it, but I was able 
                to communicate relatively complex ideas in Japanese after a lot of pausing to wrack my brain for the words and grammar. 
                I also had to ask some people to slow down their speech for me (although most people did this already seeing that 
                I wasn't a local). I did a lot of improvising and pantomiming to express ideas I didn't have the vocabulary for. 
                For example, I didn't know how to say "skin" so I said "meat paper" and pinched my arm. It was like a game of charades back 
                and forth and I don't know if I've ever had so much fun. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Before I knew it, my week was up. In review, I was really happy with how much I was able to learn in such a short 
                time. My study plan did a great job at prioritizing the most important things to learn and it was overall an 
                incredibly fun experience. Everybody I met was very supportive and appreciated that I was making an effort to learn their 
                language. It really got me thinking about just how slowly most language courses move. I figured that a course with 
                an optimized content order, practice tool, and personalized pacing could revolutionize the speed and simplicity of 
                learning a language. Hence, here we are. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                This website has been my passion project for the past few months. 
                I've been continuing my Japanese studies at a more comfortable pace and as I'm writing this (December 2023) I'm back in Japan 
                for round 2. This time I'm staying for a month and a half and I'm already so much better than last time. My vocabulary has 
                probably tripled and my grammar and comprehension are far smoother. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                That concludes the story so far, but I'm excited to see what the future has in store!
